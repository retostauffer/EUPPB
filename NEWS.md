* Added custom class and few methods for more convenient handling of the data (`eupp_stars`).
* Written a series of vignettes (`pkgdown` documentation; not yet intended as stand-allone vignettes).

# eupp 0.0-1

* Initial package design.
* Prototype; downloading/processing data only tested for forecasts, control run,
